Hello all,

I'm trying to create my first github action using python (IronPython to be more specific)
The action takes in some inputs, creates some output (dll) file that needs to be set to the output of the action.
After almost a lot of trials, I think I need help with this.

How do I access output from a test-action that uses my custom action? Any help is appreciated. TIAHello all,
